If you want to use this for outside of what PAL uses it for like mob model bends then contact me on discord so I can give you a hand. :)  
You can find the right version for you to add to your dev environment [here.](https://repo.redlance.org/#/public/com/zigythebird/bendable_cuboids)  
You're free to JiJ or include it, but please don't because the CurseForge revenue helps me out, and when it's not included users can automatically get vital patches via whatever launcher they're using for mods.

This mod is a library for other mods, and does not do anything on it's own.
